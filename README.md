## Further information
In order to play with fullscreen on Windows 10, run both bongo cat! and this application in Windows 7 compability mode.

Press Ctrl + R to reload configuration and images (will only reload configurations when the window is focused).

Supported operating system:
* Windows
* Linux (tested with Arch Linux with WINE Staging 5). Note: You **must** use WINE Staging, because for whatever reason on stable WINE bongocat-osu doesn't register keyboard input from other windows.

_Notice_: If you're using WINE on Linux, make sure that osu! and this application run in the same `WINEPREFIX`.
